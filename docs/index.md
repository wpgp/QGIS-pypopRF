# QGIS pypopRF Plugin Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the QGIS pypopRF plugin. This plugin provides a graphical user interface for the [pypopRF Python package](https://github.com/wpgp/pypopRF), integrating its population mapping capabilities directly into QGIS.

## About pypopRF

pypopRF is a powerful tool developed by the WorldPop SDI Team for creating high-resolution population distribution maps. It combines:

- Census data
- Building information
- Other geospatial covariates
- Machine learning techniques (Random Forest)
- Dasymetric mapping methods

The core functionality is provided by the [pypopRF Python package](https://github.com/wpgp/pypopRF), which can be used independently via Python for more advanced use cases. The full documentation for the Python package is available at [wpgp.github.io/pypopRF](https://wpgp.github.io/pypopRF/).

## QGIS Integration

This QGIS plugin wraps the pypopRF package functionality in a user-friendly interface, allowing you to:

- Manage your population mapping projects
- Configure input data and parameters visually
- Monitor processing in real-time
- View results directly in QGIS
- Handle parallel processing efficiently

The plugin is designed to make population mapping accessible to GIS users without requiring Python programming knowledge.

## Key Features

- **Project Management**: Easy project initialization and organization
- **Visual Interface**: Intuitive data and parameter configuration
- **Process Monitoring**: Real-time progress tracking and logging
- **QGIS Integration**: Direct visualization of results in your GIS workspace
- **Performance**: Support for parallel processing and large datasets
